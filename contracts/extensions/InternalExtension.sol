 *
 *  Base contract for Internal Extensions in the Extendable Framework
 *  
 *  Internal Extensions are used to house common functions that are used by other contract functions.
 *  This is used to make internal functions usable across all your extensions without exposing it
 *  to the external world.
 *
 *  Define your custom Extension interface and implement it whilst inheriting this contract:
 *      contract YourExtension is IYourExtension, InternalExtension {...}
 *
 *  Then define your function and simply modify it in the following way:
 *      contract YourExtension is IYourExtension, InternalExtension {
 *          function _someFunc() public _internal {}
 *      }
 *   
 *  Notice that your internal function carries both the `public` visibility modifier and the `_internal` 
 *  modifier. This is because cross-extension calls are resolved as external calls and `public` allows
 *  your other extensions to call them whilst `_internal` restricts callers to only extensions of the
 *  same contract.
 *
 *  Note:
 *  Use underscores `_` as internal function prefixes as general naming convention.
