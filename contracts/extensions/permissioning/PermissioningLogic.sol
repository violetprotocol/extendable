 * @dev Reference implementation for PermissioningLogic which defines the logic to control

 *
 * Records address as `owner` in the PermissionStorage module. Modifications and access to 
 * the module affect the state wherever it is accessed by Extensions and can be read/written
 * from/to by other attached extensions.
 *
 * Currently used by the ExtendLogic reference implementation to restrict extend permissions
 * to only `owner`. Uses a common function from the storage library `_onlyOwner()` as a
 * modifier replacement. Can be wrapped in a modifier if preferred.
