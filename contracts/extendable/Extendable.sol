 *  Inherit this contract to make your contracts Extendable!
 *
 *  Your contract can perform ad-hoc addition or removal of functions
 *  which allows modularity, re-use, upgrade, and extension of your
 *  deployed contracts. You can make your contract immutable by removing
 *  the ability for it to be extended.
 *
 *  Constructor initialises owner-based permissioning to manage
 *  extending, where only the `owner` can extend the contract.
 *  
 *  You may change this constructor or use extension replacement to
 *  use a different permissioning pattern for your contract.
 *
 *  Requirements:
 *      - ExtendLogic contract must already be deployed
